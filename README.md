The Minimalist Pokedex

This project is an attempt to create a webpage that uses API integration(PokeAPI). The overall design of the webpage is Apple-inspired and was meant to be minimalistic.
The key features of the project include........

1) Light and Dark Modes:
   
A toggle switch is available at the top-right corner of the webpage, which helps in switching between light and dark modes

Light mode: <img width="1883" height="866" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d80a36ee-b9e0-4271-b2fc-5a68977f034b" />
Dark mode: <img width="1894" height="875" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6b19ece-1cae-427a-b98d-c9ea79c6f7c0" />

2) Searching for Pokémon based on their name or ID
3) Asset colors change with respect to the primary typing of the current pokemon
4) Blur and rounded edges were applied to cards to mimic the classic "Glassmorphism" effect of Apple
5) A key toggle switch to view the shiny sprite of a Pokémon
6) Usage of type icons to indicate the primary and secondary typing of a Pokémon
7) Font used is SF Pro (San Francisco Pro), which is a commonly used font in Apple softwares/webpages.

The HTML, CSS, and JS (script and darkmode) are attached. Icons and fonts are stored separately in their respective folders.
